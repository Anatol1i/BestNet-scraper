# README for  Web Scraping and URL Validation

## Overview

This repository contains three Python scripts designed for web scraping and URL validation:
1. **Webpage Information Scraper**: Scrapes details from a specific web page using Selenium.
2. **Email Scraper**: Extracts email addresses from scraped web page links using Selenium and proxy servers.
3. **URL Checker**: Validates the functionality of URLs by sending requests.


## 1. Web Scraping Script with Selenium
### Purpose
This script uses Selenium to scrape a website, extracting details such as `names, titles, addresses, phone numbers, websites, and email links`.

### Installation
To use this script, you need to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install selenium pandas urllib3
```

### Usage
1. Download the appropriate ChromeDriver for your version of Google Chrome from ChromeDriver.
2. Update the driver = `webdriver.Chrome('path to driver')` line with the path to your ChromeDriver.
3. Set the `url, start_number, and finish_number` variables to specify the scraping range.
4. Run the script. The results will be saved as a CSV file.

### Customization
- Change url to the website you want to scrape.
- Adjust start_number and finish_number as per your requirements.
- Modify the CSS selectors and XPaths if the website structure changes.

## 2. Email Scraping with Proxy Servers
### Purpose
This script uses Selenium and proxy servers to scrape emails from web pages.

### Installation
Follow the same installation steps as the first script.

### Usage
1. Ensure you have a list of proxies and update the `get_proxies()` function with your proxy server addresses.
2. Update `chromedriver_path` with the path to your ChromeDriver.
3. Specify the input CSV file name in `df = pd.read_csv('file name ')`.
4. Run the script. The emails will be added to the existing DataFrame and saved in a new CSV file.

   
### Customization
- Provide your proxy servers in the get_proxies() function.
- Adjust the selectors and waiting times based on the target website's layout and response time.

## 3. URL Status Checker
### Purpose
This script checks the validity and status of URLs from a CSV file, using the requests library.

### Installation

To use this script, you need to install the required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas requests
```
### Usage

1. Prepare a CSV file with a column named `'Website'` containing the URLs to be checked.
2. Run the script. The status of each URL will be checked and the results will be saved in a new CSV file.

### Customization

- You can modify the headers dictionary if you need to use a different user-agent.
- Adjust the timeout and error handling based on your specific needs.
